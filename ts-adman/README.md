# Develop Advanced Extensions with SAP Cloud SDK

Welcome to this repository for the learning journey _Develop Advanced Extensions with SAP Cloud SDK_. We provide here code examples used in the learning journey exercises.

## Start the journey

As a starting point for your learning experience, we recommend you go to the full learning journey, published on [SAP Learning](https://learning.sap.com) at the following link: [Develop Advanced Extensions with SAP Cloud SDK](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/develop-advanced-extensions-with-sap-cloud-sdk).

## Current branch

This branch is part of [Exercice:Building a BP address manager extension using TypeScript](https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/develop-advanced-extensions-with-sap-cloud-sdk/exercise-building-a-bp-address-manager-extension-using-typescript_a3b13216-a20d-407c-9469-157628546623)
Current branch **tsadman_v1.0_hello** is the initial part from the exercise, where we setup a hello world application using Nest.js.

## Requirements

If you have already installed node and npm, skip the first step and jump to the second one. To check if you already have them installed, run in terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

1. Install Node and npm following [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download) .
2. Make sure you are in the root project of ts-adman. Open the terminal in this location and run:

```
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Using the Nest.js generator we generated the hello world project you can find in this branch. We will benefit from other nest cli commands in the following steps.

## Running the app

From terminal, in the root folder of project ts-adman please run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run start:dev
```
